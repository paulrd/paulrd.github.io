I've noticed the word sacred being bandied about a lot lately. Check out
http://www.yesmagazine.org/pdf/kortennewstory.pdf. I browsing the stuff written
here. The word sacred was used 55 times over 29 pages. That's almost twice per
page. Here are the instances:

  - the Sacred
  - sacred insight?
  - sacred community of life
  - sacred dimension called Heaven

  - most sacred of beings
  - All of Creation is a sacred and ultimately unified expression of an eternal 
    and intimately present divine will.
